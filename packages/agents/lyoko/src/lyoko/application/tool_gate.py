class ToolGate:
    """Authorizes the tool calls of one agent run.

    The gate serves any run, an incident phase or a chat reply. ``event_id`` identifies the run
    and prefixes its approval ids (they end up in Telegram callback data, limited to 64 bytes, so
    keep it short). ``origin`` is the line shown to the operator saying what triggered the run.
    Replies to an approval message continue ``session_id``, which defaults to ``event_id``.

    Policy, evaluated in order:

    1. If the upstream declared the tool read-only, it always runs and is not recorded.
    2. A tool matching ``read_only_patterns`` always runs and is not recorded.
    3. In ``APPROVAL`` mode, a tool matching ``auto_approved_patterns`` runs and is recorded.
    4. Anything else needs the operator: in ``APPROVAL`` mode they are asked through the chat
       connectors and the call waits for their answer; in ``READ_ONLY`` mode the call is refused.

    The upstream hint wins over the name patterns: an explicit "not read-only" is never rescued by
    a matching name, so a declared state-changing tool cannot slip through a heuristic. When the
    upstream declared nothing the name patterns decide, as before.

    Refusals are returned as text so the agent can adapt instead of crashing. When no approval
    channel is available the gate refuses rather than guessing, so a missing channel can never
    turn into an unattended change.
